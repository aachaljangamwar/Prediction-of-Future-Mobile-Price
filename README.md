# Prediction-of-Future-Mobile-Price
This project aims to predict the future price range of mobile phones using a dataset of 10,000 phones with 21 features, including battery power, RAM, 
screen resolution, and more. The objective is to develop a model that accurately predicts the price based on these characteristics.

# Dataset
The dataset contains information on:

Battery power, screen resolution, memory, weight, core count, etc.
10,000 mobile phones with 21 variables.

# Models Used
Linear Regression
Decision Tree

# Performance
Training R² Score: 91.6%
Test R² Score: 90%
Both models demonstrated strong predictive performance with an R² score of 0.91 on the test set.

# Key Features
Predicts future mobile prices based on current specifications.
Provides insights into how different factors like battery, RAM, and screen resolution impact mobile prices.

# Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NumPy)
Jupyter Notebook
